Hello, I am a research and en educator based out of Dayton Ohio, USA.
I teach adjunct at the University of Dayton, in the Computer Science department, and work as a researcher apply AI techniques to Hardware Security.
My passion is educating others, and always learning new things.

I geek out over a proper manual espresso pull, discussing education methods, and cooking!
If you don't find me at work, you'll see my struggling to keep up with my 4 cats and 2 dogs (Cleo-catra, Ella Catsgerld, Walter Grumpy, Meow-vatar Kora, Indiana Bones, and Winry Barkbell).

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
