# My Teaching Methodology
My goal as an educator is to guide students through a new subject, as an expert in the material.
My courses feature active learning through reflection, in-class examples, group work, and personalized assignments.
Identifying key goals and outcomes with my students at the beginning of the semester alerts them to my expectations, and allows them to plan for their own personal learning goals.
After completing my course, a successful student will have a grasp on the material and the ability to apply what they have learned in an industry or academic position.

# Courses Developed
## University of Dayton 
### Data Science
Data Science is the act of extracting real, meaningful insights and patterns for often noisy and unreliable data sources, which can then be used to inform and drive actions and decisions.
The course covers recent advancements in the field, and how they are used for enhancing data quality and processing.
Topic covered include exploratory data analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, how to perform critical review of academic literature, data bias and ethics, statistical learning, and a brief introduction to neural networks.

### Software Project Management
A study of effort and cost estimation models for software projects, planning techniques, productivity metrics, risk management, structuring and leading software teams, CMMI, ISO, IEEE/EIA, Agile, Scrum and PMBOK frameworks for managing software projects, and ethical issues. 
Students will learn how to critically review literature, make high level technical decisions, and investigate proposal writing for industry-oriented research and development.

## Non-Affiliated 
### Introduction to Evolutionary Computing
Currently developing a course around using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to solve complex problems.
Topics range from the Canonical Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Strategies, Genetic Programming, and simple Memetic Algorithms.
